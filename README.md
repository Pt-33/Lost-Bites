In this project,a user can share information of any of the snack that is currently not available and also allows the other users to like /unlike them.And it keeps track of the count of likes and displays the most liked/missed snack.

Steps to execute:
1)Create a react folder in your project by using the create-react-app command and name it as frontend.
2)Include the src files from the ones I have shared.
3)Create another folder named as backendserver and include the server.js and install node modules using the package.json files that I have shared.
4)To run frontend: npm start
5)Open another terminal to start the backend server:npm start
